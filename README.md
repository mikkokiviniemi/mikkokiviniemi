I'm currently studying Software Engineering in Tampere University. I enjoy working on modern C++ and Python, and I'm always eager to learn and grow in my field.

## Skills

- **Languages:** C++, Python, Java, SQL
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** MQTT, Qt
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, Visual Studio, Qt Creator

## Projects

### Control software ⚙️🖥️🔧
> The purpose of the Control Software is to control the production line automatically or based on commands from the UI. The goal was to run the production line without breaking the hardware and optimize output. We use shared memory to communicate with the simulated hardware and MQTT to communicate with the UI.

### Conway's Game of Life 🌱🎮👾
> Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton that is played on a 2D square grid. Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules:
>- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).
>- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).
>- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
>- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.
